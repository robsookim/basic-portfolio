            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Robin Kim. I was born in Daegu, South Korea but moved to New York City when I 
                was 1 years old. I moved around a couple times but ended up setting in Bayside. I went to 
                Bronx High School of Science then to NYU Tandon School of Engineering for a Biomolecular Science
                degree. In the middle of degree, I ruined my back and ended up taking time off of class, where
                I decided to teach myself some basic code to pass the time. This was where I realized that 
                coding was what I truly wanted to continue with and not biology. I am currently working as an EMT
                and doing this Coding Boot Camp. I have one brother who is 7-8 years younger than me (depending)
                on the month, and a dog named Goolbi, who I love more than my parents or my brother. My biggest 
                regret is probably stopping art when I was younger.
